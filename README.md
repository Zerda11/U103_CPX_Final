## INSTRUCTIONS
This project requires the Adafruit CircuitPlaygroundExpress board.

Only the 2 buttons on the board are used as inputs but in many ways.

When the program starts you will be able to use each button to cycle through pixels on the board from blue to red, blue being easier and red being harder.

Once you have settled on a difficulty you can hold down both of the buttons for about a second to switch to the game this is also how you can return to difficulty select.

The game itself chooses a random pixel and highlights it and the another pixel the color of your difficulty will be moving around the LED's.  Your job is to press either of the buttons when the moving light is on the stationary light.

You can press either of the buttons because you might need to move your fingers to see the lights interacting.
